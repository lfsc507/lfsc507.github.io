    "\n",
    "This is a hands-on introductory programming course with the emphasis on analyzing and visualizing biological data. The course will cover basic programming concepts including core data types, functions, flow control, modules, classes and interactions with files. It will also introduce popular libraries for numerical computing, data analysis, machine learning and scientific plotting. Toy examples in areas of structural biology, cell imaging, transcriptomics, genomics and systems biology will be used. Students are encouraged to bring their own data analysis/modeling projects to the course and work on them as a part of the graded component. Upon completing the course, students will be able to use programming tools to perform data analysis, to make publication quality plots, and to learn advanced computational methods with the help of coding. Python will be used as the primary programming language of the course."

Alternatively, it can be a package to model and simulate a particular biological system. Students are encouraged to use their own datasets (e.g. collected for their own research interests or obtained from their current or previous labs) for the project. The project is evaluated based on a written research plan (10% of the project grade) and a final software package (BCMB 420: 90%, LFSC 507: 50%). For students taking LFSC 507, a written final report is required (40%). The report summarizes the scientific and/or technical contributions of the project to a research field.\n",
